# Unit Test

Provides a great opportunity to write and refactor your code to follow a TDD process.
More often than not we're usually tempted to skip this part.
If the plugin skeleton was prepared using the ```Plugin Builder``` tool then the plugin folder will have some boiler-plate test that are auto generated. But this shouldn't be a reason to add more Unittests for the code base.

some community driven tools for qt gui test include ```Qtest```, ```pytest-qt``` [1](http://johnnado.com/pyqt-qtest-example/), [2](https://pytest-qt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) respectively.
This comes in handy for future support and clear outline for future guideline for new contributors.
